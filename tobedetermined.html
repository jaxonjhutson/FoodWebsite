                <p class="generaltxt">I've never eaten cactus before, but I'd really like to try it. You'd think that with cactus being the kind of defensive plant that it is, it wouldn't be very good as a food item, but I'm told that it is.</p>

                <p class="generaltxt">Hello! This is Food: Friend or Foe, a food blog made by me, a random guy on the internet that you should most definitely trust! This is where I share my opinions about various food items, these opinions are objectively correct and any dissagreement is a sure sign of mental illness and terrible moral character. Happy reading!</p>
