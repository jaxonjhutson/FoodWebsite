                <p class="generaltxt">Hello! This is Food: Friend or Foe, a food blog made by me, a random guy on the internet that you should most definitely trust! This is where I share my opinions about various food items, these opinions are objectively correct and any dissagreement is a sure sign of mental illness and terrible moral character. Happy reading!</p>
